Locate email.csv with TextSuggestion.py to build a model:

WordCompletor provides several options to continue your prefix. It's logical and convenient as it can't be unobvious to choose only one. WordCompletor works quite accurate as usually to continue a word no context is required so we need only understand the structure of the language. There are some problems with endings (in languages like Russian it can be more crucial)

Next word suggestion. It's quite strange to predict lots of various n-length options so we'll choose one. The problem of n-gramm approach is it's limitations of what the model have seen. It can't be effectivly fixed without deep learning.

Out app provides from 1 to 3 alternative of current word completion and 1 n-size words suggestion.
